## TypeScript Type System Learnings

### Winston Logger Integration
**Date: [Current Date]**

#### Challenge
Integrating winston-logflare with proper TypeScript types presented several challenges:
1. Missing type definitions for winston-logflare
2. Type compatibility issues between winston's transport types and third-party transports
3. Complex type hierarchy in winston's type system

#### Solution
1. Created custom type definitions:
```typescript
declare module 'winston-logflare' {
  import { transport } from 'winston';

  export interface LogflareTransportOptions {
    apiKey: string;
    sourceId: string;
    batchSize?: number;
    flushInterval?: number;
  }

  export class LogflareTransport implements transport {
    constructor(options: LogflareTransportOptions);
    log(info: any, callback: () => void): void;
    logv2(info: any, callback: () => void): void;
    close(): void;
  }
}
```

2. Used type assertion for compatibility:
```typescript
loggerTransports.push(new LogflareTransport(options) as unknown as transport);
```

#### Best Practices
1. When working with third-party modules lacking TypeScript definitions:
   - Create a dedicated types directory in the package
   - Use declaration files (.d.ts) for type definitions
   - Follow the module's runtime behavior closely when defining types

2. For winston transport compatibility:
   - Implement the transport interface
   - Use type assertions judiciously when type hierarchies don't align perfectly
   - Keep transport options interfaces as specific as possible

3. Type Safety vs Pragmatism:
   - Balance perfect type safety with practical implementation
   - Use `unknown` before `any` when type assertions are necessary
   - Document type assertions with comments explaining the necessity

## Workspace Management

### PNPM Workspace Commands
**Date: [Current Date]**

#### Learnings
1. Package Installation:
   - Use `-w` flag for workspace root: `pnpm add -w package-name`
   - For individual packages: `cd packages/package-name && pnpm add package-name`
   - Avoid using `&&` in PowerShell, use semicolons instead

2. Command Execution:
   - Run commands across all packages: `pnpm -r command`
   - Run in specific package: `pnpm --filter package-name command`
   - Use turbo for optimized execution: `pnpm turbo run command`

#### Best Practices
1. Package Management:
   - Keep shared dependencies at workspace root
   - Package-specific dependencies in individual packages
   - Use exact versions for consistent builds

2. Script Execution:
   - Prefer turbo for running scripts across packages
   - Use consistent script names across packages
   - Add appropriate flags for non-interactive environments

## Code Organization

### Monorepo Structure
**Date: [Current Date]**

#### Best Practices
1. Package Organization:
   - Group related functionality into packages
   - Keep packages focused and single-purpose
   - Share common utilities through dedicated packages

2. Configuration Management:
   - Use TypeScript for configuration files
   - Centralize common configurations
   - Allow package-specific overrides

3. Type Definitions:
   - Maintain types close to their implementation
   - Share common types through a types package
   - Use declaration merging judiciously

## Operational Guidelines

### Development Workflow
**Date: [Current Date]**

1. Before Making Changes:
   - Check existing type definitions
   - Review package dependencies
   - Understand the type system implications

2. During Implementation:
   - Write type definitions first
   - Test with strict TypeScript settings
   - Document type assertions and workarounds

3. After Changes:
   - Run full type checking: `pnpm typecheck`
   - Run linting: `pnpm lint`
   - Update documentation with learnings

### Troubleshooting Guide

1. Type Errors:
   - Check import paths
   - Verify type definitions exist
   - Review type compatibility
   - Consider type assertions as last resort

2. Build Issues:
   - Verify package dependencies
   - Check TypeScript configuration
   - Review module resolution settings

3. Runtime Issues:
   - Enable detailed logging
   - Use type guards for runtime safety
   - Add appropriate error handling

## Future Improvements

1. Type System:
   - Create more specific types for logger info objects
   - Reduce usage of type assertions
   - Improve error message types

2. Build System:
   - Optimize turbo pipeline
   - Add build caching
   - Improve development experience

3. Documentation:
   - Add more code examples
   - Document common patterns
   - Create troubleshooting flowcharts
