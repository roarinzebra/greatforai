## Implementation Notes

1. **Animation Requirements** (per Motion Primitives docs):
   - All interactive elements require at least 3 states: initial, hover, tap
   - Use spring physics for natural motion (stiffness: 170, damping: 26)
   - Mobile: max animation duration 300ms

2. **Accessibility** (WCAG 2.1 AA):
   - All data grids require ARIA 1.2 roles
   - Charts need textual alternatives
   - Focus management for interactive elements

3. **Performance Budget**:
   - Initial load < 100kb per visualization component
   - FPS > 60 during interactions
   - CLS < 0.1 for layout shifts

4. **Required Integrations**:
   - TanStack Table v8.9
   - react-spring v9.7 (for physics-based animations)
   - Recharts v2.8
   - react-virtuoso v4.1
