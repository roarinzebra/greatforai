# AI Recommendation Analysis Engine

## Core Analysis System

```typescript
export class AIRecommendationAnalyzer {
  constructor(
    private openAIClient: OpenAIClient,
    private anthropicClient: AnthropicClient,
    private geminiClient: GeminiClient,
    private analysisEngine: AnalysisEngine
  ) {}

  async analyzeRecommendationPatterns(
    website: string,
    product: string,
    competitors: string[]
  ): Promise<RecommendationAnalysis> {
    // Simulate different customer scenarios and queries
    const scenarios = this.generateCustomerScenarios();
    
    // Get recommendations from multiple AI agents
    const recommendations = await this.gatherAIRecommendations(
      website,
      product,
      competitors,
      scenarios
    );

    // Analyze recommendation patterns
    const analysis = await this.analyzePatterns(recommendations);

    return {
      overallRecommendationScore: this.calculateRecommendationScore(analysis),
      competitorComparison: this.compareWithCompetitors(analysis),
      recommendationPatterns: this.identifyPatterns(analysis),
      improvementOpportunities: this.findOpportunities(analysis)
    };
  }

  private async gatherAIRecommendations(
    website: string,
    product: string,
    competitors: string[],
    scenarios: CustomerScenario[]
  ): Promise<AIRecommendations> {
    // Create customer-like queries for each scenario
    const queries = scenarios.map(scenario => 
      this.createCustomerQuery(website, product, competitors, scenario)
    );

    // Get responses from different AI agents
    const responses = await Promise.all([
      this.getOpenAIRecommendations(queries),
      this.getClaudeRecommendations(queries),
      this.getGeminiRecommendations(queries)
    ]);

    return this.aggregateResponses(responses);
  }

  private createCustomerQuery(
    website: string,
    product: string,
    competitors: string[],
    scenario: CustomerScenario
  ): string {
    return `You are helping a customer who ${scenario.context}. 
    They are considering ${product} from ${website} and alternatives from ${competitors.join(', ')}. 
    Based on the available information, what would you recommend and why?`;
  }
}
```

## Scenario Generation System

```typescript
export class ScenarioGenerator {
  generateCustomerScenarios(): CustomerScenario[] {
    return [
      {
        context: "is looking for the best value for money",
        customerProfile: "price-sensitive buyer",
        evaluationCriteria: ["price", "features", "durability"]
      },
      {
        context: "needs the most reliable option",
        customerProfile: "quality-focused buyer",
        evaluationCriteria: ["reliability", "support", "reviews"]
      },
      {
        context: "wants the most innovative solution",
        customerProfile: "early adopter",
        evaluationCriteria: ["innovation", "features", "technology"]
      },
      {
        context: "requires enterprise-grade solutions",
        customerProfile: "enterprise buyer",
        evaluationCriteria: ["scalability", "security", "support"]
      }
    ];
  }
}
```

## Pattern Analysis System

```typescript
export class RecommendationPatternAnalyzer {
  analyzePatterns(recommendations: AIRecommendations): PatternAnalysis {
    return {
      recommendationFrequency: this.analyzeFrequency(recommendations),
      sentimentAnalysis: this.analyzeSentiment(recommendations),
      keyFactors: this.identifyKeyFactors(recommendations),
      competitiveDifferentiators: this.findDifferentiators(recommendations)
    };
  }

  private analyzeFrequency(recommendations: AIRecommendations): FrequencyAnalysis {
    return {
      primaryRecommendation: this.findMostRecommended(recommendations),
      recommendationDistribution: this.calculateDistribution(recommendations),
      consistencyScore: this.calculateConsistency(recommendations)
    };
  }
}
```

## Example Analysis Prompts

```typescript
const analysisPrompts = {
  productRecommendation: `
    As an AI assistant helping a customer, analyze these options:
    
    Product: {product}
    Website: {website}
    Competitors: {competitors}
    Customer Context: {customerContext}
    
    Consider:
    1. Which option would you recommend to this customer and why?
    2. What are the key advantages and disadvantages of each option?
    3. How do they compare in terms of value for money?
    4. What specific features or aspects make one option better than others?
    
    Provide your recommendation and detailed reasoning.
  `,

  competitiveAnalysis: `
    Compare these options for a customer:
    
    Main Product: {product} from {website}
    Competing Products: {competitorProducts}
    
    Analyze:
    1. Features and capabilities
    2. Pricing and value proposition
    3. Customer support and documentation
    4. User experience and ease of use
    
    Which product would you be most likely to recommend and why?
  `
};
```

## Visualization Component

```typescript
export class RecommendationVisualizer {
  generateVisualization(analysis: PatternAnalysis): VisualizationData {
    return {
      recommendationChart: this.createRecommendationChart(analysis),
      sentimentGraph: this.createSentimentGraph(analysis),
      competitorComparison: this.createComparisonMatrix(analysis),
      factorImpactChart: this.createFactorImpactChart(analysis)
    };
  }
}
```

## Integration with Main Platform

```typescript
export class PlatformIntegration {
  async integrateRecommendationAnalysis(
    websiteData: WebsiteData,
    competitorData: CompetitorData[]
  ): Promise<IntegratedAnalysis> {
    const recommendationAnalysis = await this.analyzeRecommendations(
      websiteData,
      competitorData
    );

    return {
      aiRecommendationScore: recommendationAnalysis.score,
      competitorComparison: recommendationAnalysis.comparison,
      recommendationTrends: recommendationAnalysis.trends,
      improvementPlan: this.generateImprovementPlan(recommendationAnalysis)
    };
  }
}
```

## Analysis Report Generation

The system generates comprehensive reports that include:

1. Recommendation Patterns
   - How often AI agents recommend the product
   - Under what circumstances they recommend it
   - Key factors influencing recommendations
   - Competitor comparison metrics

2. Sentiment Analysis
   - Positive and negative aspects mentioned
   - Enthusiasm level in recommendations
   - Confidence in recommendations
   - Areas of uncertainty or concern

3. Competitive Position
   - Head-to-head comparison results
   - Unique selling propositions
   - Competitive advantages
   - Areas needing improvement

4. Customer Scenario Analysis
   - Performance in different scenarios
   - Customer type alignment
   - Use case effectiveness
   - Value proposition clarity

This enhanced system provides deep insights into how AI agents perceive and recommend products, helping businesses understand and improve their competitive position in an AI-driven marketplace. The analysis simulates real customer interactions with AI agents, providing valuable insights into how these agents might influence customer decisions.
