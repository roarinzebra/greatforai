# AIAO Platform Prioritization Plan

## Strategic Context

Before diving into priorities, let's understand our key constraints and requirements:

1. Non-technical project lead working with AI coding tools
2. Need for a quick MVP release
3. Requirement for free and paid tier structure
4. Development using AI assistance (Cursor)

These factors significantly influence our prioritization decisions. Here's how we should proceed:

## Phase 1: Core MVP (Months 1-3)

### Priority 1: Basic Website Analysis Engine
**Reasoning**: This represents our core value proposition and can provide immediate value to users. It's also relatively straightforward to implement with AI coding tools as it follows common patterns.

Key Components:
- Basic crawler implementation
- Simple metadata analysis
- Core SEO checks
- Basic reporting interface

We'll start with these because:
- They provide immediate value to users
- The implementation patterns are well-documented
- AI coding tools excel at implementing standard web crawling and analysis patterns
- They form the foundation for more advanced features

### Priority 2: Simple User Interface
**Reasoning**: A clean, simple interface is crucial for early adoption and can be built efficiently using existing UI components.

Key Components:
- User authentication
- Dashboard with basic metrics
- Simple report viewing
- URL submission interface

This priority makes sense because:
- It enables user engagement with our core features
- Shadcn/UI components reduce implementation complexity
- AI coding tools are particularly effective with React components
- It provides a foundation for user feedback

### Priority 3: Free Tier Implementation
**Reasoning**: This enables market entry and user acquisition while we develop premium features.

Key Components:
- Usage limits implementation
- Basic analytics
- Simple report generation
- Core feature access controls

## Phase 2: Premium Features (Months 4-6)

### Priority 4: Knowledge Graph Basic Implementation
**Reasoning**: This differentiates our product and provides the foundation for advanced features.

Key Components:
- Basic content relationship mapping
- Simple visualization
- Core optimization suggestions
- Basic pattern recognition

### Priority 5: Payment Integration and Tier Management
**Reasoning**: This enables revenue generation while maintaining free tier access.

Key Components:
- Stripe integration
- Tier management system
- Usage tracking
- Premium feature gating

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Months 7-9)

### Priority 6: AI Agent Interaction Tracking
**Reasoning**: While this is a unique selling point, it's more complex to implement and should come after core features are stable.

Key Components:
- Basic agent detection
- Simple interaction logging
- Basic pattern recognition
- Initial recommendations

### Priority 7: Advanced Analytics and Reporting
**Reasoning**: These features enhance value for paying customers and build on existing infrastructure.

Key Components:
- Detailed analytics dashboard
- Custom report generation
- Advanced visualizations
- Trend analysis

## Implementation Strategy

Given the non-technical leadership and AI-assisted development approach, we should:

1. Start with Well-Documented Patterns
- Focus on features that have clear implementation examples
- Use established libraries and frameworks
- Leverage existing code patterns

2. Implement Iteratively
- Build features in small, testable chunks
- Regular testing and validation
- Frequent user feedback collection

3. Utilize AI Coding Assistance Effectively
- Start with clear, detailed requirements
- Use AI tools for boilerplate code generation
- Focus human review on business logic and security

## Free vs Paid Tier Structure

Free Tier Features:
- Basic website analysis
- Limited number of pages
- Basic reporting
- Standard update frequency

Paid Tier Features:
- Advanced analysis
- Unlimited pages
- Custom reporting
- Real-time updates
- AI agent tracking (when available)
- Priority support

## Risk Mitigation

Given our development approach, we should:
1. Implement extensive automated testing
2. Use type-safe code generation
3. Implement strong validation
4. Regular security audits
5. Maintain comprehensive documentation

## Technical Decisions

Regarding React 19 and Next.js 15:
1. Our initial plan specified React 18 and Next.js 14 because:
   - They are current stable versions
   - They have extensive documentation
   - AI coding tools have more training data on these versions
   - They have proven production reliability
   - They have broader ecosystem compatibility

2. However, we can adapt to React 19 and Next.js 15 if:
   - They are stable by our development start date
   - Their new features provide significant benefits
   - They maintain compatibility with our core dependencies
   - AI coding tools demonstrate reliable support

For our MVP phase, using stable versions reduces risk and improves development predictability, especially with AI-assisted development. We can upgrade later when the newer versions have matured and AI tools have better support for them.
