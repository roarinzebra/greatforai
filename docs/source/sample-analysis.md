## 2. Dynamic Content Adaptation Analysis

### Current Content State
```typescript
interface ContentAnalysis {
  pageTypes: {
    product: {
      clarity: 0.85,
      completeness: 0.78,
      technicalDepth: 0.92
    },
    documentation: {
      clarity: 0.72,
      completeness: 0.88,
      technicalDepth: 0.95
    },
    research: {
      clarity: 0.65,
      completeness: 0.91,
      technicalDepth: 0.97
    }
  }
}
```

### Adaptation Recommendations

1. Product Pages Transformation:
```typescript
const productPageAdaptations = {
  current: {
    structure: "Feature-based listing",
    aiReadability: 0.75
  },
  recommended: {
    structure: "Use-case centered hierarchy",
    expectedAiReadability: 0.94,
    changes: [
      {
        type: "restructure",
        element: "product features",
        from: "bullet-list",
        to: "semantic-groups",
        rationale: "Group features by medical use case for better AI comprehension"
      },
      {
        type: "enhance",
        element: "technical specifications",
        action: "add contextual relationships",
        rationale: "Connect specifications to clinical outcomes"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

2. Documentation Enhancement:
```typescript
const documentationAdaptations = {
  current: {
    structure: "Traditional hierarchy",
    aiReadability: 0.82
  },
  recommended: {
    structure: "Knowledge graph-based navigation",
    expectedAiReadability: 0.96,
    changes: [
      {
        type: "transform",
        element: "navigation",
        action: "implement concept-based linking",
        rationale: "Enable AI agents to follow conceptual relationships"
      },
      {
        type: "enhance",
        element: "code examples",
        action: "add semantic annotations",

    aiComprehension: 0.71
  },
  enhanced: {
    text: "HealthMonitor Pro provides continuous real-time monitoring of patient vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, enabling early detection of clinical deterioration",
    aiComprehension: 0.94,
    addedContext: {
      medical: ["vital sign parameters", "clinical monitoring"],
      technical: ["real-time data", "continuous monitoring"],
      outcomes: ["early detection", "patient safety"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Technical Documentation:
```typescript
const documentationEnhancements = {
  original: {
    content: "API endpoint /vitals accepts POST requests",
    aiComprehension: 0.68
  },
  enhanced: {
    content: "The /vitals endpoint accepts POST requests containing patient vital sign data, conforming to HL7 FHIR standards for medical data interchange",
    aiComprehension: 0.92,
    addedContext: {
      technical: ["REST API", "FHIR standard"],
      security: ["medical data handling", "HIPAA compliance"],
      integration: ["health systems", "EHR compatibility"]
    }
  }
